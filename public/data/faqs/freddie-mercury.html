He attended British boarding schools in India during his early years, where he began taking piano lessons and formed his first band, The Hectics. His family moved to England in 1964 to escape the Zanzibar Revolution. Mercury was of Parsi-Indian descent and practiced Zoroastrianism.

                    <div class="faq-answer">Freddie Mercury's vocal range was extraordinary, spanning four octaves. Though his speaking voice was baritone, he sang most songs as a tenor, and his ability to switch styles rapidly was notable.
