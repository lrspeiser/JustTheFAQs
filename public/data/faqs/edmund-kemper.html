                    <div class="faq-answer">Edmund Emil Kemper III, born on December 18, 1948, in Burbank, California, is a notorious American serial killer. He was convicted of murdering eight individuals, including seven women and one girl, between 1972 and 1973. Kemper's first murders were of his grandparents when he was just 15 years old. He is infamously known as the 'Co-ed Killer' because most of his victims were female college students hitchhiking in Santa Cruz County, California. His murders typically involved necrophilia, decapitation, and dismemberment.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What was Kemper's early life like?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Edmund Kemper exhibited troubling behavior from a young age, including cruelty to animals and disturbing fantasies. He experienced a highly dysfunctional family life, particularly with his mother, Clarnell. His father described his relationship with Clarnell as more stressful than wartime experiences. Kemper was notably larger than his peers and suffered from a lack of affection and severe abuse from his mother, which many believe contributed to his later violent behaviors.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper killed eight victims, including his mother and her friend. He often preyed on female students who he picked up while driving around Santa Cruz. His methods included shooting, strangling, and then taking the bodies to perform post-mortem acts. Kemper's resentment towards his mother was a significant factor in his subsequent murders.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">After murdering his mother and her friend in April 1973, Kemper fled to Colorado. Surprisingly, he voluntarily called the police to confess. During his trial, he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but was found sane and guilty of eight counts of first-degree murder. He received concurrent life sentences due to a moratorium on capital punishment in California at the time.</div>
