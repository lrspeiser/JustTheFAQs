              <div class="faq-question">How historically accurate is the film 'Zulu'?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">While 'Zulu' captures the general events of the Battle of Rorke's Drift accurately, it takes liberties with certain character portrayals and events for dramatic purposes. Some British soldiers' characters are fictionalized, and the film presents a mythologized version of the regiment. A factual mistake is portraying the regiment as predominantly Welsh, although it was mostly composed of English soldiers at the time. The film's portrayal of other historical figures and interactions is also dramatized for intensity and impact.</div>
