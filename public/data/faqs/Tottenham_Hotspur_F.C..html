              <div class="faq-question">What is the design of Tottenham Hotspur’s crest and how did it develop?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The crest features a cockerel standing on a football. Initially introduced in 1921, it symbolizes the fighting spirit associated with the club, inspired by Harry Hotspur. In the 1950s, a heraldic shield was incorporated into the design. The current modernized version, introduced in 2006, features a sleeker cockerel without the shield, though it was briefly reintroduced between 2017-2018.</div>
