                    <div class="faq-answer">The United States Marine Corps Aviation (USMCA) is the aviation arm of the United States Marine Corps. Its primary purpose is to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force as the aviation combat element by providing six main functions: assault support, anti-air warfare, close air support, electronic warfare, command and control, and aerial reconnaissance. The Corps operates rotary-wing, tiltrotor, and fixed-wing aircraft to provide transport and close air support, as well as a variety of support and special-purpose roles. Marine Corps aviation is overseen by the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, advising on matters related to aviation acquisition, operations, and maintenance.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">When did Marine Corps aviation begin and who was the first Marine aviator?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Marine Corps aviation officially began on May 22, 1912, when First Lieutenant Alfred A. Cunningham reported to Naval Aviation Camp in Annapolis, Maryland, for duty related to aviation. On August 20, 1912, Cunningham became the first Marine aviator after taking off in a Burgess Model H provided by the Burgess Company in Marblehead Harbor, Massachusetts.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did Marine Corps aviation evolve during World War I and the interwar period?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Marine Corps' air component significantly expanded during World War I. By the end of the war, Marine aviators had recorded substantial air-to-air combat successes and dropped over fourteen tons of bombs. During the interwar period, Congress authorized the creation of permanent air stations and increased the strength of Marine aviation. Marine Corps aviators developed innovative air-ground support tactics, such as dive bombing and air resupply, which became crucial in later military engagements.</div>
