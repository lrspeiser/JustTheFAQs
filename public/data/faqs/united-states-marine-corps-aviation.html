              <div class="faq-question">What is the United States Marine Corps Aviation?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The United States Marine Corps Aviation (USMCA) is the aviation arm of the United States Marine Corps. Its primary purpose is to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force as the aviation combat element by providing six main functions: assault support, anti-air warfare, close air support, electronic warfare, command and control, and aerial reconnaissance. The Corps operates rotary-wing, tiltrotor, and fixed-wing aircraft to provide transport and close air support, as well as a variety of support and special-purpose roles. Marine Corps aviation is overseen by the Deputy Commandant for Aviation, advising on matters related to aviation acquisition, operations, and maintenance.</div>
