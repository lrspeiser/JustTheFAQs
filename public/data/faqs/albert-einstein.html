                    <div class="faq-answer">Einstein's fascination with electromagnetism was sparked at a young age during a significant incident when he was sick in bed. His father handed him a magnetic compass, which led Einstein to the lifelong wonder about the unseen forces of nature, remarking that "something deeply hidden had to be behind things."</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What are the 'Annus Mirabilis' papers, and why are they significant?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">In 1905, often referred to as Einstein's 'Annus Mirabilis' (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers in physics that contributed significantly to the foundation of modern physics. These papers addressed the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, introducing the world-famous equation E=mc². Together, they changed the understanding of space, time, and energy in profound ways.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did Einstein view the relationship between God and science?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Einstein described his spirituality in terms of a pantheistic belief, similar to that of Baruch Spinoza. He rejected the notion of a personal God who interferes in the fate and actions of human beings. However, Einstein did not identify as an atheist, preferring agnosticism, or as a 'deeply religious nonbeliever'. He often spoke of a profound admiration for the structure of the universe and thought the pursuit of science created a special kind of religious feeling.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Why is Albert Einstein often considered the quintessential icon of genius?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Albert Einstein is widely considered a genius as a result of his groundbreaking contributions to theoretical physics, which reshaped humanity's understanding of the universe. His formulation of the theory of relativity and the equation E=mc² have become synonymous with scientific creativity and insight. Einstein's intellectual achievements transcended the scientific community, making him a cultural icon and the face of genius in popular culture.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What was Einstein's involvement with the Manhattan Project?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Einstein's role in the Manhattan Project came indirectly through his signing of a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939. The letter, largely written by physicist Leó Szilárd, warned the U.S. government of Nazi Germany's potential development of atomic bombs and urged the U.S. to accelerate its own atomic research. Though Einstein was a known pacifist, he reluctantly signed the letter due to concerns about the potential for Nazi Germany to create such weapons.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What role did music play in Einstein's life?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Music was an integral part of Einstein's life from a young age, providing him enjoyment and solace. He once said, 'If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician.' His mother encouraged him to learn the violin as a child, and although he didn't enjoy it initially, he developed a profound appreciation for it over time, particularly the works of Mozart and Beethoven. This passion for music accompanied him throughout his life, offering him an escape from the rigors of scientific thought.</div>
