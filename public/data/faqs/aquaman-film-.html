                    <div class="faq-question">What were some challenges faced during the production of Aquaman?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">One of the significant challenges faced during production was filming the underwater sequences. Director James Wan noted the complexity of shooting the 'underwater world,' which required innovative filming techniques such as actors being shot dry-for-wet on special rigs, and later digitally doubled. Several visual effects (VFX) vendors participated in creating the digital environments and CGI animals, pushing the boundaries of hair simulation and digital animation for fluid underwater effects.</div>
