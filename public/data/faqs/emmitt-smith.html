                    <div class="faq-answer">Emmitt James Smith III was born in Pensacola, Florida, and he attended Escambia High School, where he played high school football and ran track. Smith became the second-leading rusher in American high school football history, rushing for 8,804 yards and 106 touchdowns. He helped Escambia win two state championships. Despite this, some college recruiters questioned his potential, deeming him too small and slow for major college football. Nonetheless, he was honored as the USA Today and Parade magazine High School Player of the Year in 1986 and was later named the Florida high school football 'Player of the Century' by the FHSAA in 2007.</div>
