              <div class="faq-question">How did Tyler's policies lead to conflicts with his own party?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">John Tyler faced substantial conflicts with the Whig Party, which he had been elected with. Although initially deferring to Whig leaders, he vetoed key party bills like the establishment of a national bank, believing in a strict interpretation of the Constitution. This led to most of his cabinet resigning and his subsequent expulsion from the party, earning him the nickname "His Accidency."</div>
