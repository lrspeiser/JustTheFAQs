                    <div class="faq-answer">Super Bowl XXVIII was a pivotal American football game played on January 30, 1994, between the Dallas Cowboys, champions of the National Football Conference (NFC), and the Buffalo Bills, champions of the American Football Conference (AFC). The game determined the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1993 season. The Cowboys defeated the Bills 30-13, securing their fourth Super Bowl victory and tying the Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers for the most Super Bowl wins at the time. This Super Bowl marked the last time two teams faced each other in consecutive finals, with the Bills losing their fourth straight Super Bowl.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Atlanta was chosen as the host city for Super Bowl XXVIII during an NFL owners' meeting on May 23, 1990, in Irving, Texas. The city was selected in part to reward Falcons owner Rankin Smith for keeping the team in Atlanta and orchestrating the construction of the Georgia Dome. Four cities submitted bids, but Atlanta's was preferred due to support from Tampa Bay representatives when Tampa was eliminated in the voting process. Conditions were attached due to ongoing construction of the Georgia Dome, but these were met, allowing Atlanta to host the event.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did the Dallas Cowboys perform during the 1993 NFL season leading up to the Super Bowl?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Dallas Cowboys faced several challenges during the 1993 season. Superstar running back Emmitt Smith held out the first two games over a contract dispute, leading to losses in those games. However, after Smithâ€™s return and signing of a lucrative contract, he and the team bounced back with a seven-game winning streak. The Cowboys finished with a 12-4 record, clinching the NFC East title with a dramatic victory over the New York Giants, where Smith played through injury to secure a playoff bye and ultimately a Super Bowl victory.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What was notable about the Buffalo Bills' fourth consecutive Super Bowl appearance in 1993?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Buffalo Bills' journey to their fourth consecutive Super Bowl appearance was marked by a 12-4 record and securing the best regular-season record in the AFC. Despite their strong offense led by quarterback Jim Kelly and running back Thurman Thomas, who led the AFC in rushing, the Bills struggled defensively, ranking low in the league. Their appearance in Super Bowl XXVIII underscored their inability to secure a championship, as they became the first team to lose four consecutive Super Bowls.</div>
