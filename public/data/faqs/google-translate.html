              <div class="faq-question">How did Google Translate evolve to use neural machine translation?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">In November 2016, Google announced the switch to a neural machine translation engine called Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT). This system translates entire sentences instead of piece by piece, using broader context to create translations that better resemble human speech with correct grammar.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How does Google Translate's translation methodology work?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Google Translate uses a method that first translates text into English before translating into the target language, especially in cases of less commonly translated language pairs. It initially used statistical data from translated documents but now employs neural machine translation for better linguistic accuracy by examining broader sentence contexts.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How has Google Translate evolved since its launch?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Google Translate was launched in April 2006 as a statistical machine translation service. Initially, it used UN and European Parliament documents to train its models. In November 2016, Google transitioned to neural machine translation, which improved translation quality by considering whole sentences and their broader context. By 2024, Google added support for 110 languages, including regional languages from various parts of the world.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How accurate is Google Translate and what factors affect its performance?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Google Translate's accuracy varies with the structure of the input text and the languages being translated. It's generally more accurate with formal, well-structured text and more commonly used language pairs. However, accuracy becomes a challenge with less common languages, slang, literary language, and complex syntactic structures.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">Google Translate's accuracy varies depending on the language pairs and complexity of the text. For simple and structured texts, especially between high-resource languages and English, it can provide translations similar to human translators. However, the accuracy decreases with less structured sentences, idiomatic expressions, and complex grammatical structures. It struggles with polysemy and often chooses the most common word meanings. Despite these limitations, Google Translate remains an invaluable tool for grasping the gist of foreign texts when no human translation is available.</div>
