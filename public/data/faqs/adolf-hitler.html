                    <div class="faq-question">What is known about Hitler's early life and family background?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary, to Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl. He was the fourth of six children, but only he and his sister Paula survived to adulthood. His father, Alois, was a customs official, and Hitler had a difficult relationship with him. Hitler showed early artistic talent, but his father wanted him to pursue a career in the civil service, leading to conflict between them. After his father's death in 1903, Hitler struggled with his education and eventually dropped out.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did Hitler rise to power in Germany?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Hitler's rise to power began in the early 1920s when he joined the German Workers' Party, which would later become the Nazi Party. His oratory skills and propaganda attracted widespread attention. In 1923, he attempted a coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch, which failed, leading to his imprisonment. During his time in prison, he wrote 'Mein Kampf,' in which he outlined his ideology. The economic turmoil of the Great Depression increased Nazi Party popularity, and in 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. The Reichstag Fire and the Enabling Act gave him dictatorial powers.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What role did Hitler play in the events leading up to and during World War II?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Adolf Hitler's aggressive foreign policies were central to the outbreak of World War II. He sought to expand Germany's territories, beginning with the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland. His invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Hitler's initial military strategies led to rapid victories across Europe, but his decision-making became increasingly erratic. Stalingrad marked a turning point, after which the Axis powers faced defeat. Hitler's war ended with his suicide as Allied forces closed in on Berlin in 1945.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did Hitler's ideology shape his policies during his time in power?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Adolf Hitler's ideology was primarily focused on extreme nationalism, anti-Semitism, and the pursuit of lebensraum (living space) for Aryan Germans. His belief that Jews were the root of Germany's problems led to the Holocaust, where six million Jews were systematically murdered. Domestically, Hitler established a totalitarian regime, suppressed opposition, and aggressively pursued military rearmament, leading to conflict with multiple nations. His policies were aimed at creating a unified, racially pure state, which led to widespread atrocities and the devastation of World War II.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Adolf Hitler died by suicide on 30 April 1945 in his bunker in Berlin as Soviet forces approached the city. He shot himself, and his wife Eva Braun also took her life. Hitler's body was set on fire as per his instructions. In the years following World War II, Hitler's legacy has been defined by the extreme destruction and human suffering caused by his policies, particularly the Holocaust. His dictatorship set a precedent as one of the deadliest regimes in history, sparking discussions on the dangers of totalitarianism and unchecked power.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Despite his public image, Hitler had a complex personal life. He was in a long-term relationship with Eva Braun, whom he married just before their deaths. He showed interest in religion but had a contentious relationship with traditional religious institutions, expressing disdain for Christianity in private. Hitler was also known for his vegetarian diet and abstention from alcohol in his later years. His leadership style was autocratic, and he believed in the Führerprinzip, demanding absolute obedience from his subordinates and ensuring his views were unchallenged, contributing to his centralized control over Nazi Germany.</div>
