                    <div class="faq-question">What challenges did George VI face in his early life and education?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Born as Albert Frederick Arthur George in 1895, George VI was the second son of King George V. He was not originally expected to become king. Throughout his childhood, he faced numerous personal challenges, including a stammer and being forced to write with his right hand despite being naturally left-handed. He also had health issues like knock knees, corrected painfully with splints. His upbringing was common for children of his class where parental involvement was limited, impacting his self-confidence.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did George VI's military service influence his life and reign?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">George VI, known then as Prince Albert, served in the Royal Navy and later the Royal Air Force during World War I. His military service, including serving as a turret officer during the Battle of Jutland, inculcated a sense of duty and discipline that marked his reign. This experience helped him relate to the armed forces during World War II, boosting morale by sharing hardships with his subjects and engaging in public duties despite personal fears stemming from his stammer.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did George VI's marriage impact his role as king?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">George VI wed Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, an event marking modernity for the monarchy as Elizabeth was not of royal birth. She played a significant role as his consort, offering support especially during his early struggles with public speaking. Their marriage bore two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, and Elizabeth later succeeded him as Queen Elizabeth II. Their close family life was a source of stability for George during the challenges of his reign.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did George VI handle the transition from the British Empire to the Commonwealth?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">King George VI presided over the British Empire during a pivotal time of transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.

                    <div class="faq-answer">George VI's health was significantly impacted by the stress of his reign and heavy smoking. He developed lung cancer and arteriosclerosis, which led to his declining health in the early 1950s. Despite major surgery to remove a lung, his health continued to deteriorate, leading to his death from a coronary thrombosis on February 6, 1952, at Sandringham House. His death paved the way for his daughter, Elizabeth II, to ascend the throne.</div>
