                    <div class="faq-question">What is a domestic cat?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The domestic cat (Felis catus), also known as the house cat or cat, is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. They have adapted from their wild ancestors to live synergistically in human habitats as domesticated pets.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is the origin of the word 'cat'?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The word 'cat' in English, derived from the Old English 'catt', likely originates from the Late Latin word 'cattus'. This term may have its roots in an unidentified African language. Variations of the word exist in many languages, including the Nubian 'kad&s' and Nobiin 'kad&icirc;ska'. Other forms such as 'puss' or 'pussy' used colloquially in English-speaking areas may have ties to similar-sounding words in Dutch, Scandinavian, and Lithuanian languages.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did the domestic cat evolve?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Domestic cats descend from the Felidae family, which evolved around 10 to 15 million years ago. The domestic cat specifically diverged from other members of the genus Felis roughly 6 to 7 million years ago and underwent domestication in the Near East around 7500 BC. This evolution included natural selection for traits advantageous to living near humans.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How were cats domesticated?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The domestication of cats is believed to have occurred as early farmers in the Fertile Crescent tamed wildcats that were attracted to their settlements by the presence of rodents. This relationship likely began around 7500-7200 BC. Over time, these cats became more accustomed to human presence, leading to their domestication. Wildcats from Egypt later contributed to the domestic cat's gene pool.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Why are cats excellent night hunters?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cats have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in one-sixth the light needed by humans, largely due to their eyes having a reflective layer called the tapetum lucidum. This adaptation helps them to be formidable nocturnal predators. Additionally, their acute sense of hearing and smell aid in locating and capturing prey at night.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is the social behavior of cats?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cats are generally solitary hunters but engage in social behaviors when living in groups, such as colonies. Within these groups, social hierarchies exist, often led by a dominant cat. Cats use vocalizations, scent markings, and body language for communication. They can show affection towards humans and other animals, often treating human keepers as mother figures.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is unique about a cat's hunting method?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cats use two primary hunting strategies: stalking prey actively or ambushing prey. They prefer to hunt small animals like rodents and birds. Their unique anatomy, including retractable claws and sharp teeth, aids in grasping and killing prey efficiently. They are obligate carnivores, meaning their diet requires nutrients found only in animal meat.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How do domestic cats reproduce?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Cats are induced ovulators, which means the act of mating stimulates the release of eggs. Female cats, or queens, experience multiple estrous cycles during the year and can mate with several males. After a gestation period of about 64-67 days, a queen can give birth to a litter of kittens, which can have different fathers due to the multiple matings that can occur.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">A cat's lifespan can be influenced by factors such as genetics, diet, environment, and medical care. Neutering can increase life expectancy by reducing risks of certain diseases and behavioral issues. On average, domestic cats live around 13 to 17 years, but some may live over 20 years. Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations are essential for maintaining health.</div>

They have been revered and sometimes feared across different cultures, from ancient Egyptian society, where they were worshipped, to superstition-filled medieval Europe, where black cats were associated with witches. Their role as pest controllers has been appreciated since ancient times.</div>
