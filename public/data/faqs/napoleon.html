                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon's rise to power began during the French Revolution when he was promoted to brigadier general after his successful defense of Toulon.

                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon's most notable military victories include the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, where he defeated Russian and Austrian forces, and the Battle of Jena in 1806, where he secured victory over the Prussians.

                    <div class="faq-question">What led to Napoleon's downfall and exile?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon's downfall began after his failed invasion of Russia in 1812, which decimated his Grande Armée due to the harsh winter and scorched earth tactics by the Russians. After a series of defeats, including the Battle of Leipzig, he abdicated in 1814 and was exiled to the island of Elba. He returned to power briefly but was defeated again at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon is considered one of history's greatest military leaders, and his Napoleonic Code set the foundation for modern legal systems in many countries. Despite his military successes, he is controversial for his role in European wars and his rule as a dictator. His conquests spread French revolutionary ideals, and his reforms had lasting impacts on the European state system.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon was born in Corsica to a family of Italian ancestry. He married Joséphine de Beauharnais in 1796, though the marriage was later annulled. He then married Marie Louise of Austria, with whom he had a son, Napoleon II.

                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon's military strategies are studied for their innovative use of mass conscription, rapid movement of troops, and decisive battles. His organization of the army into corps and his ability to divide and defeat larger enemy forces through effective use of terrain and feigned retreats are considered highly advanced and influential in military history.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">Napoleon managed religious matters by establishing the Concordat of 1801, which reconciled the Catholic Church with his regime and restored its status in France while maintaining state control over its operations. This move helped to stabilize his rule and gain support among the religious population. He also granted civil rights to Protestants and Jews, promoting religious tolerance.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">The Hundred Days refers to Napoleon's brief return to power in 1815 after escaping exile from Elba. He regained control of France and raised a new army, but was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by the Seventh Coalition led by the Duke of Wellington and Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. Following this defeat, Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena, where he spent the rest of his life.</div>
