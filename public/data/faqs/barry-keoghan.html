                    <div class="faq-question">What challenges did Barry Keoghan face in his early life?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Barry Keoghan was born on October 18, 1992, in Dublin, Ireland. His early life was marked by adversity; his mother struggled with drug addiction and passed away when he was just 12 years old. Subsequently, Keoghan spent seven years in foster care, living in 13 different foster homes along with his brother Eric, until they were raised by their grandmother and other relatives. He began acting in school plays but was banned for 'messing about', and later found his initial film education by sneaking into cinema screenings.</div>
