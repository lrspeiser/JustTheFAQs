                    <div class="faq-question">How did John Tyler ascend to the presidency?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">John Tyler became the 10th President of the United States after President William Henry Harrison died of pneumonia just a month into his term. Tyler, who was Harrison’s Vice President, assumed the presidency on April 4, 1841, setting precedence as the first Vice President to ascend to the presidency due to the death of a sitting President.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What was John Tyler's impact on the precedent of presidential succession?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">John Tyler set a crucial precedent in presidential succession by asserting that he had assumed the full powers and the position of the presidency, not just acting as a caretaker or vice president. This claim was crucial in establishing the principle that the Vice President fully becomes President in the event of the current President's death, which was eventually codified by the 25th Amendment.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did Tyler's policies lead to conflicts with his own party?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">John Tyler faced substantial conflicts with the Whig Party, which he had been elected with. Although initially deferring to Whig leaders, he vetoed key party bills like the establishment of a national bank, believing in a strict interpretation of the Constitution. This led to most of his cabinet resigning and his subsequent expulsion from the party, earning him the nickname "His Accidency."</div>
