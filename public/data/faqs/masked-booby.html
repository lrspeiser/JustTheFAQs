              <div class="faq-question">What are the distinctive physical features of the masked booby?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The masked booby, also known as the masked gannet or blue-faced booby, is the largest species of booby, measuring between 75–85 cm (30–33 in) in length with a wingspan of 160–170 cm (63–67 in). It features a distinctive sulid shape with a long pointed yellowish bill, a long neck, an aerodynamic body, long slender wings, and a pointed tail. The adult is bright white with black on the wings, a black tail, and a dark facial mask, giving an appearance of wearing a mask. The sexes have similar plumage, and there is no seasonal variation in their appearance.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Behavior and Diet</div>
              <div class="faq-question">What is notable about the feeding behavior of masked boobies?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Masked boobies are known for their spectacular diving abilities, plunging from heights of 12 to 100 meters (40 to 330 feet) into the ocean to catch fish. They typically target flying fish and other fish species for their diet. These birds often forage out at sea and may travel significant distances from their colonies. During feeding trips, they are noted for their absence of rest at sea and return trips that can sometimes extend into nighttime.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Reproduction</div>
              <div class="faq-question">How do masked boobies reproduce and care for their young?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Masked boobies are monogamous and often form long-term pair bonds. They nest in colonies typically on remote islands using a simple scraped nest where the female lays two chalky white eggs. Incubation lasts about 45 days and involves both parents. Unfortunately, siblicide is common where the younger chick is typically expelled or killed by its older sibling. After fledging at about 120 days, the offspring remain dependent on their parents for additional weeks before fully dispersing to the sea.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Conservation Status</div>
              <div class="faq-question">What is the conservation status of the masked booby?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The masked booby is classified as a "Least Concern" species by the IUCN due to its wide distribution and large population size. However, there are threats that may affect local populations, such as overfishing which impacts food availability, and climate change, which may threaten some low-lying breeding colonies due to rising sea levels and possible reduction in food productivity.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Habitat and Distribution</div>
              <div class="faq-question">Where can masked boobies be found?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The masked booby can be found across tropical oceans, mainly between the 30th parallel north and 30th parallel south. Its range includes areas around the Arabian Peninsula, East African coasts, Western Australia, and several oceanic islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. In the Caribbean and Atlantic, they are found as far south as Ascension Island. They are known to disperse at sea at times, with some records of vagrants reaching as far as Newport, Oregon, and areas like the Gulf Stream off the east coast of the United States.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Interesting Facts</div>
              <div class="faq-question">Are there any unique behaviors during courtship for masked boobies?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Masked boobies engage in unique courtship behaviors such as "sky-pointing," where the male stretches his neck and points his bill skyward, pacing with his wings slightly raised. This is accompanied by a faint whistle when a female approaches. They also perform ritualized presentations of sticks and debris as part of their courtship display, although no nest material is ultimately used in the nesting process itself.</div>
