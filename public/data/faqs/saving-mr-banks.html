              <div class="faq-question">How accurate is 'Saving Mr. Banks' in portraying historical events?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">While 'Saving Mr. Banks' depicts many real events, it takes some creative liberties. For instance, it fictionalizes a key plot point where Disney convinces Travers to hand over the film rights. In reality, Disney had acquired the rights before she arrived in Hollywood but needed her approval on the script. The film also suggests Travers was ultimately pleased with 'Mary Poppins', though in reality, she was displeased with the animated sequences and some character portrayals.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How historically accurate is 'Saving Mr. Banks'?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">While 'Saving Mr. Banks' portrays many real-life events, some elements are fictionalized or dramatized. Disney had already secured the rights to 'Mary Poppins' and Travers's interactions with him, and the Disney staff are compressed and altered for narrative sake. Travers actually never came to terms with certain changes Disney made to her story and maintained her displeasure with the animated sequences.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">'Saving Mr. Banks' takes creative liberties with historical events for cinematic purposes. The film suggests that Disney worked hard to persuade Travers to sell the film rights, however, the rights were already secured before Travers came to the studio. The character of Ralph and the depiction of dialogue between Travers and Disney are fictionalized to some extent. Travers' real-life reactions to the film were also more negative than shown in the movie.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">'Saving Mr. Banks' was initially developed as an independent production before Disney acquired the screenplay, becoming involved due to the film's subject matter. An interesting aspect of the film's production was the access granted to 36 hours of recorded conversations between P. L. Travers and Disney's creative team from the 1960s. Additionally, the filmmakers recreated the Disneyland environment to reflect its 1961 appearance for certain scenes.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">While 'Saving Mr. Banks' portrays many actual events, it fictionalizes certain elements, such as the extent of Walt Disney's efforts to persuade P.L. Travers. Disney had actually secured film rights before her trip to Los Angeles. The film also simplifies Travers' complicated feelings about the Disney adaptation, neglecting some of her lasting discontent over the film's animated segments. Additionally, the characterization of some figures, such as Traversâ€™ chauffeur, is fictionalized to enrich the story's narrative.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">'Saving Mr. Banks' takes creative liberties in retelling the story of Disney's pursuit of the 'Mary Poppins' film rights. Contrary to the movie's portrayal, Disney had already secured these rights prior to Travers' visit.

              <div class="faq-answer">Initially, 'Saving Mr. Banks' was an independent project developed by Essential Media Entertainment and BBC Films. In 2011, producer Alison Owen approached Walt Disney Pictures for permission to use copyrighted elements. This led Disney to acquire the screenplay and co-produce the film.

              <div class="faq-answer">The idea for 'Saving Mr. Banks' originated from a documentary film about P.L. Travers by Australian producer Ian Collie. The screenplay, which recounts both Travers' childhood and the Mary Poppins rights negotiations, attracted attention for its portrayal of Disney and Travers' creative conflict. The film was initially developed independently by Essential Media and Entertainment and BBC Films. Walt Disney Pictures later acquired the rights and produced the film after securing the necessary permissions to use Disney's music and imagery.</div>
