              <div class="faq-question">What events led up to the Battle of Rorke's Drift?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The battle occurred as a result of the British engagement at Isandlwana, where a British column, after issuing an ultimatum to the Zulus, crossed into Zulu territory and was subsequently defeated. The Rorke's Drift mission station, initially a supply depot and hospital, was left with a small garrison under the command of Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead. As Zulu forces approached, the decision was made to fortify the position rather than retreat, given the vulnerability of a small column in open country. The Zulu regiment, known as the Undi Corps, attacked Rorkeâ€™s Drift after leaving Isandlwana.</div>
