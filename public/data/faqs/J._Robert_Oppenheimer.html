              <div class="faq-question">What was Oppenheimer’s role in the Manhattan Project?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Oppenheimer served as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he led scientists in the development of the atomic bomb. His leadership was integral to the success of the first nuclear weapon test, known as the Trinity Test, in 1945. Despite security concerns due to his past political associations, his scientific expertise was deemed essential for the project.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">What was J. Robert Oppenheimer’s early education and family background?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Oppenheimer was born into a non-observant Jewish family. His father, Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, was a successful textile importer, and his mother, Ella Friedman, was a painter. From an early age, Oppenheimer showed a great aptitude for learning. He attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, then went on to Harvard College where he majored in chemistry while also studying physics, literature, and philosophy. His interest in science was spurred by courses in experimental physics and thermodynamics.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How did Oppenheimer's career and legacy evolve post-World War II?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">After World War II, Oppenheimer became a prominent advocate for controlling nuclear power and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. He became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and influenced scientific thought and policy. However, his career was marred by a 1954 security hearing that investigated his past political associations, leading to the revocation of his security clearance. This event became emblematic of the era's suspicion and political tension but also highlighted issues of scientific responsibility. In 1963, he received the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">General Overview</div>
              <div class="faq-question">Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer and why is he well-known?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist born on April 22, 1904, in New York City. He is best known for his role as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during the Manhattan Project, the World War II undertaking that developed the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb." Oppenheimer played a significant role in American and international science communities, contributing to the development of the atomic age.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">What is known about Oppenheimer’s personal life and interests?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Oppenheimer was known for his diverse interests beyond physics, including literature and languages, having learned several, including Sanskrit, which allowed him to read Hindu scriptures. He was married to Katherine Puening, with whom he had two children. His personal struggles included periods of depression, chain smoking, and complex political affiliations. He also had a profound appreciation for the arts, reflected in his expansive art collection.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Scientific Contributions</div>
              <div class="faq-question">What are some notable scientific contributions made by Oppenheimer?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Oppenheimer made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which separates nuclear motion from electronic motion in quantum mechanical calculations. His works also detailed theories in quantum electrodynamics and the prediction of black holes. His collaboration with Melba Phillips led to the Oppenheimer-Phillips process in nuclear fusion. He contributed to the understanding of neutron stars and black holes through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</div>
