              <div class="faq-subheader">Overview</div>
              <div class="faq-question">What is ChatGPT and how was it developed?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, initially launched in November 2022. It is based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM) and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. ChatGPT has contributed significantly to the AI boom by gaining rapid public attention and investment in AI technology. Despite its popularity and success, there are concerns about its potential to displace human intelligence, plagiarism, and propagate misinformation. ChatGPT reached over 100 million users in just two months, becoming the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.</div>

              <div class="faq-subheader">Training and Fine-Tuning</div>
              <div class="faq-question">How is ChatGPT trained and fine-tuned for its applications?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">ChatGPT is trained using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Human trainers played both roles—of user and AI assistant—and ranked AI responses to improve the model’s performance. This feedback loop employs techniques like proximal policy optimization to further refine the model over several iterations.</div>
