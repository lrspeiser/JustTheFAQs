              <div class="faq-question">How did Instagram become a part of Meta Platforms?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Instagram was acquired by Facebook (now Meta Platforms) for about $1 billion in cash and stock in April 2012. The deal was meant to keep Instagram independently managed, and both the UK's Office of Fair Trading and the US Federal Trade Commission approved the acquisition. At the time, Instagram had a rapidly growing user base, reaching 1 billion users by June 2018.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">How did Instagram start and who created it?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Instagram began as Burbn, a mobile check-in app developed by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in San Francisco. It initially received seed funding of $500,000 from Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. Realizing it was too similar to Foursquare, the creators refocused it on photo-sharing and renamed it Instagram, a blend of instant camera and telegram.</div>

              <div class="faq-answer">Research has indicated potential negative impacts of Instagram on mental health, especially among teens, due to social comparison and body image issues.
