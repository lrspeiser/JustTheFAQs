                    <div class="faq-answer">The first time zone to experience the New Year is located in the Line Islands, Kiribati, which is 14 hours ahead of UTC. The last places to celebrate the New Year are the uninhabited Howland and Baker Islands in the Pacific Ocean, which are 12 hours behind UTC. This is due to their position relative to the International Date Line.</div>
