                    <div class="faq-question">What factors led to the start of World War II?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">World War II was primarily caused by the unresolved tensions following World War I and the rise of fascism in Europe and militarism in Japan. Key events contributing to the outbreak included Japan's invasion of Manchuria, the Spanish Civil War, the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and Germanyâ€™s annexations of Austria and the Sudetenland. Notably, the war is widely considered to have begun on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland.</div>
