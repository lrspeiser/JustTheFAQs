                    <div class="faq-answer">The PDC World Darts Championship originated from a schism in the sport in 1994, when the World Darts Council (WDC) broke away from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). The championship was initially known as the WDC World Darts Championship and was part of efforts by players to have a more professional environment. The WDC later became the PDC following a settlement with the BDO, with players free to choose between the two organizations until the BDO folded in 2020.</div>
