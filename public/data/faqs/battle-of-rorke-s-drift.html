                    <div class="faq-question">What was the Battle of Rorke's Drift and its significance in the Anglo-Zulu War?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Battle of Rorke's Drift, also known as the Defence of Rorke's Drift, was a significant engagement during the Anglo-Zulu War in which a small British and colonial force of just over 150 men successfully defended the Rorke's Drift mission station against an intense assault by 3,000 to 4,000 Zulu warriors. This battle, which took place on January 22-23, 1879, was notable for the British defense despite being heavily outnumbered. It is remembered for the awarding of 11 Victoria Crosses to the defenders and served to counterbalance the defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana on the same day.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What events led up to the Battle of Rorke's Drift?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The battle occurred as a result of the British engagement at Isandlwana, where a British column, after issuing an ultimatum to the Zulus, crossed into Zulu territory and was subsequently defeated. The Rorke's Drift mission station, initially a supply depot and hospital, was left with a small garrison under the command of Lieutenants John Chard and Gonville Bromhead. As Zulu forces approached, the decision was made to fortify the position rather than retreat, given the vulnerability of a small column in open country. The Zulu regiment, known as the Undi Corps, attacked Rorkeâ€™s Drift after leaving Isandlwana.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How did the defenders prepare for the attack at Rorke's Drift?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Under the command of John Chard and Gonville Bromhead, the defenders constructed a defensive perimeter out of mealie bags, biscuit boxes, and crates of tinned meat. The perimeter included the storehouse and hospital, with loopholes drilled into walls for firing. The troops, including soldiers, patients, and some civilians, were strategically positioned to resist a much larger Zulu force that was expected. The British made the most of their resources, organizing their defense against possible Zulu attacks from multiple directions.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What happened during the Battle of Rorke's Drift?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The battle began around 4:20 p.m. with the arrival of the Zulu forces. Initially, Natal Native Horse units retreated, leaving the remaining garrison of about 154-156 men to fight. Despite the overwhelming numbers, the defenders managed to hold the Zulus at bay with strategic use of their defenses and disciplined volleys of rifle fire. The hospital was set ablaze during the attack, and defenders like Privates John Williams and Alfred Henry Hook had to rescue patients and themselves through fierce close-quarter combat. Despite repeated assaults, the British held the Zulus off throughout the night.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What were the outcomes and consequences of the Battle of Rorke's Drift?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Battle of Rorke's Drift resulted in a remarkable British victory, with the small garrison successfully repelling the Zulu assault despite being heavily outnumbered. The British sustained 17 casualties and had numerous wounded, with only about 900 rounds of ammunition left out of 20,000. In contrast, around 351 Zulu warriors were killed with estimates of several hundred more wounded. The battle had significant morale-boosting effects for the British following their defeat at Isandlwana, and it drew significant media attention. The defenders received numerous awards, including 11 Victoria Crosses.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">Why were so many Victoria Crosses awarded after the Battle of Rorke's Drift?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders of Rorke's Drift due to the extraordinary acts of bravery displayed during the battle. This was the greatest number of VCs awarded for a single action to one regiment, highlighting the importance of the battle in British military history. Some historians suggest that the high number of awards was partially a reaction to counteract the negative impact of the British defeat at the Battle of Isandlwana earlier the same day. Despite some criticism regarding the number of awards, the acts of valor at Rorke's Drift were undeniable.</div>
