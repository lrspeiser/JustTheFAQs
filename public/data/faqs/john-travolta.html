                    <div class="faq-question">What was John Travolta's upbringing like and how did it influence his career?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">John Travolta was born in 1954 in Englewood, New Jersey, the youngest of six children in an Irish-American family. Raised Catholic, he grew up in a household with a strong Irish cultural influence before converting to Scientology at age 21 after being introduced to Dianetics by former actress Joan Prather. His father was a former American football player who turned to selling tires, and his mother was an actress and singer who later became a drama teacher. These artistic influences from his mother and siblings led them into acting careers, greatly inspiring John Travoltaâ€™s own path into the realm of acting.</div>
