                    <div class="faq-answer">Natalia Grace (Barnett) Mans, born in 2003, is a Ukrainian-born American adoptee with dwarfism. She became widely known due to a controversial adoption story where her adoptive parents, the Barnetts, claimed she was much older than her birth records indicated. In 2012, they legally changed her birth year to 1989, claiming she was an adult posing as a child. However, DNA tests in 2023 estimated her age to be around 22 at that time, supporting her original birth year. Her story has inspired television series and raised many debates about adoption and age verification.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What is known about Natalia's early life before her adoption?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Natalia was born in Ukraine to Anna Volodymyrivna Gava of Mykolaiv and was placed in an orphanage due to a diagnosis of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare form of dwarfism. She first entered the U.S. through previous adoptive placements before being adopted by the Barnetts in 2010.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">What were the circumstances surrounding Natalia's abandonment by her adoptive parents?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">In 2012, the Barnetts managed to change Natalia's birth record to age her by roughly 14 years and moved her to an apartment alone in Indiana before relocating to Canada, leaving her behind. Natalia was later taken in by the Mans family, who found her struggling to live independently. The Barnetts faced neglect charges, but issues over Natalia's true age complicated the legal proceedings.</div>

                    <div class="faq-question">How has Natalia Grace's case attracted legal and media attention?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Natalia's situation caught significant media attention, especially with court proceedings questioning her real age. The Barnetts were charged with neglect, but the charges against Michael Barnett were dismissed. Natalia's biological mother was located in Ukraine, confirming her original birth year through DNA. Her story has been featured in TV series such as 'The Curious Case of Natalia Grace' and will be the basis of an upcoming Hulu series, adding to the media portrayal of her complex story.</div>
