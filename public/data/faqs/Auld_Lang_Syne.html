              <div class="faq-question">Who originally composed "Auld Lang Syne", and how did it become popular?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Although Robert Burns is credited with writing "Auld Lang Syne" in 1788 by sending it to the Scots Musical Museum, it was based on a traditional folk tune. Burns claimed it was an old song never before printed. The version of the melody universally known today was first published in 1799 in George Thomson's "Select Songs of Scotland". The tune is believed to be a pentatonic Scots melody that was originally a quicker dance-tempo.</div>

              <div class="faq-question">What is the origin and significance of "Auld Lang Syne"?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">"Auld Lang Syne" is a Scottish song and a poem written by Robert Burns in 1788. It is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year at midnight on New Year's Eve. Based on older Scottish folk songs, it was set to a traditional pentatonic tune in 1799, which has since become the standard melody. The phrase "Auld Lang Syne" translates to "old long since," or more colloquially, "long long ago," "days gone by," or "times long past." It symbolizes a call to remember long-standing friendships and is often used at funerals, graduations, and Scout jamborees.</div>
