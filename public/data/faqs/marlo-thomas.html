                    <div class="faq-question">What was the significance of Marlo Thomas's role in "That Girl"?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Marlo Thomas's role in "That Girl," where she portrayed Ann Marie, was significant for its portrayal of a single, independent woman pursuing a career in New York City. The show was one of the first to focus on a working single woman who did not live with her parents, paving the way for future series featuring similar themes. Thomas was also a pioneer as she was one of the few women at the time to produce her own television series. She opted to end the series on her terms, avoiding a conventional wedding finale to reflect a progressive message for her female audience.</div>
