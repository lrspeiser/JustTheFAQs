                    <div class="faq-question">Where was Prince Philip born and what is significant about his early life?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Prince Philip was born on 10 June 1921 on the dining room table in Mon Repos, a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. As a prince of both Greece and Denmark, Philip's early life was marked by exile from Greece when he was only eighteen months old. His family faced political turmoils, particularly during the Greco-Turkish War, leading to their evacuation onboard the British vessel HMS Calypso, with the infant Philip carried to safety in a fruit box. Despite these turbulent beginnings, Philip was related to several European royal families, including the Greek and Danish royal families, a fact that influenced his upbringing and future alliances.</div>
